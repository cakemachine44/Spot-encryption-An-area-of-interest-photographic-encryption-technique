# Spot-encryption-An-area-of-interest-photographic-encryption-technique

With cameras being used everywhere, modern 
techniques for computation and memory-usage must be 
implemented for efficient and optimal performance. For 
instance, real-time surveillance requires little delay therefore,
the encryption technique applied should be light weight to 
maintain good Quality of Experience (QOE) and relatively 
strong security. This project proposes the use of traditional 
block and stream cipher techniques, AES and RC4 respectively, 
to heavily encrypted a detected region of interest in a 
photograph while quickly encrypting the background region. To 
accomplish this, the region of interest will be encrypted by either 
one of the following AES modes; Electronic Code Book (ECB), 
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), and Counter (CTR) while the 
background encryption will be done using RC4.
Keywordsâ€”object detection, region-of-interest, cryptography, 
hybrid encryption, AES, RC4, ECB, CBC, CTR, Python.
